## Configuration

To run this application locally or in a production environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Git (optional if you already have the code downloaded).

### Clone the Repository

If you don't have the code on your machine yet, clone this repository from GitHub:

````bash
git clone <url-repository-name>
cd <url-repository-name>

Translated with DeepL.com (free version)

### Execute the Project 

Once the container is running, open your web browser and access the application at:

http://localhost:3000/nasa/images
This will take you to the NASA image search interface. You can enter search terms and view the corresponding images.


### Notes:

- Replace `<url-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository.
- Replace `<repository-name>` with the actual name of your local repository.
- Be sure to include any other application-specific settings or additional instructions that are necessary for proper operation.

This README provides a detailed and organized guide for users and developers to configure, run, and understand your Node.js application that uses the NASA API to display space-related images.
